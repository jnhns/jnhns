# Hey there! 👋 I'm Jana (pron: yah-nuh), a Sound Designer 🎧

## About Me
- 📸 Museum specimen photographer and 🎧 Sound designer by day, accidental web developer by... well, today
- 🤷‍♀️ Honestly have no idea what I'm doing with code, but somehow got a website working
- 🚀 Just launched [opneem.co.za](https://opneem.co.za) (and I'm as surprised as you are that it works)
- 🔧 My approach: try stuff, break stuff, Google how to fix stuff, repeat
- 📍 South Africa

## Current Status
- ✅ Successfully didn't break GitHub (yet)
- 🎯 Goal: Keep my website running and work on game audio projects without accidentally deleting the internet
- 🎮 Exploring the wild world of interactive audio design

## My Projects
- **[Opneem](https://opneem.co.za)** - My first venture into web development 🎉
- **Sound Design Work** - The thing I actually know how to do
- **Museum Photography** - Capturing specimens that can't run away
- **Game Audio** - Making virtual worlds sound less virtual

## Skills
- 🎵 Sound Design & Audio Production 
- 📷 Specimen photography
- ✂️ Video Editing 
- 💻 Breaking code creatively
- 🔍 Professional Googler of error messages

## Fun Facts
- 💨 Started editing fart sound effects from the age of 13 (peak comedy achieved early)
- ⏰ I once spent 3 hours figuring out why my website showed HTML code instead of... a website
- 👂 I have undiagnosed sensory sensitivity (sound) - ironic career choice, I know
- 🦋 I photograph things that used to be alive for museums (they're excellent models)
- 🎲 Currently trying to make game worlds sound as chaotic as my coding process
- ☕ Powered by curiosity, caffeine, and the occasional existential crisis about technology
